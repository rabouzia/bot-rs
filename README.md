🌐 Bot-RS

A small project to explore the world of Telegram, Discord, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and TikTok bots — through something we all care about: scraping and interacting with social media and weather data.

☀️ Overview

Bot-RS is a cross-platform bot framework that scrapes real-time data from weather services, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and TikTok, delivering it to users through stylish and intuitive bots — whether you’re chatting on Telegram or hanging out on Discord.

🤖 Telegram

Built using Teloxide
 — a clean and powerful Rust framework for Telegram bots.

Just type /weather Paris to get your forecast, or /insta @username to scrape recent Instagram posts!

💬 Discord

Powered by Serenity
, one of the most mature Discord bot libraries in Rust.

Get weather updates, recent Instagram posts, the latest trends from X, or the hottest TikToks — all directly in your Discord server with interactive embeds and flair.

🌍 Why this project?

Because bots are fun. And Rust makes them fast, safe, and reliable. Combining weather scraping, social media interactions, and Rust’s performance offers a powerful toolkit for real-time engagement and automation.
